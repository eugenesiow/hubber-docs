# Hubber.space

[Hubber.space](http://hubber.space) is an decentralised experimental sandbox application server developed to realise the core functions of the Social Web of Things. It is powered by a fast selective-publish MQTT broker using the disruptor pattern for efficient queue management.

Things can connect to Hubber.space servers to publish and subscribe to information from a social network of other Things. The  data management layer integrated uses [PIOTRe](https://github.com/eugenesiow/piotre-web), a personal Internet of Things repository. PIOTRe supports the ingestion, storage and processing of IoT time-series data on resource-constrained devices.

The source code of Hubber.space is available on Github \([https://github.com/eugenesiow/hubber-bp](https://github.com/eugenesiow/hubber-bp)\).
